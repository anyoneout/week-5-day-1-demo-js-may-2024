# Day 1 Task

Examine the example of a text swapping button at ____.

Create your own webpage with at least 3 pages and 3 js script files. (4 pages if you include index.html)

Each page should have a header paragraph and button. The button will use JavaScript to change the text of the header and paragraph by changing its innerHTML.

Add an index.html page to link your pages together in a nav. 

Bonus: Feel free to spruce things up with CSS or to add more tags you'd like to change.

Bonus: exercise your skill by adding a little math or string template magic to your page. Get creative and have fun

If you don't understand why or how this works, that's OK. Just know we will delve deeper into functions and events later in the class.

## User Story

We can explain what we want a program to do with "User Stories". This is an industry standard way of explaining the specifications for software in a way that both technical and non-technical stakeholders can understand.

A user story for this task could be:

    As a USER, I want to click a button to turn the text of "I like cats" to "I like dogs".

This could be repeated with other pages like so:

    As a USER, I want to click a button to turn the text of "I like cookies" to "I like ice cream".

In future assignments, watch out for more examples of User Stories.
